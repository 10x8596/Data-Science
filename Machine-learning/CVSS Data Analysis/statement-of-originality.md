## Declaration
  I declare that everything that I have submitted in this assignment is entirely my own work, with the following exceptions:

In the fields below, replace 'N/A' with appropriate words, in case this applies
to you.  'N/A' stands for 'Not Applicable', which implies that this does not
apply to you (this is the default).  IF this does not apply to you, then leave the 'N/A' as is.

Add as many "name+comment" entries as necessary

### Collaboration:
If you have discussed any questions or solutions with other students of the course (COMP2420 & COMP6420), you must note this here. They must also note it in their solution.

    comment:
      N/A


Add as many "url+licence+comment" entries as necessary

### Code:
If you copied (or slightly changed) code from a friend or external website (for example), you must reference it here. Even if you change the variable name or slightly change the functions, it must still be referenced here.


  - comment: For Logistic Regression's Halving Grid Search, my implementation (The one I did for KNN) was not working, therefore from the website I used their implementation of creating variables to pass to 
  the hyperparameter dictionary. I've also chosen the parameters to tune from their implementation (C and penalty) and added my own solver parameter.

   - comment: To create a multi-class confusion matrix heatmap using seaborn, I've used the code from this Stack overflow post to do so.

   - comment: For the second task, calculating the sub-scores and base scores, I took inspiration and learned how to implement np.vectorize from this stack overflow post about numpy vectorization to speed up my code.

### Assets:
If you use any Python packages (other than the ones already used in the course: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, sqlite3), it must be referenced here.
