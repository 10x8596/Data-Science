### Timing

The final exam will start at 12:20 pm (Canberra time) on Saturday the 04th of June 2022. The exam will have 15 minutes reading time and 180 minutes writing time.

We will allow a ten minutes early start (i.e. from 12.10pm) for admin matters to be done.  In these 10 minutes, students can set up their recording system, show id, decrypt the exam file, sign their statement of originality and do the recommended test PUSH to the server (more details on this below).  Students **cannot** start attempting their exam in these 10 minutes, these are purely for admin set-up.


### Structure

The final exam will consist of 5 main questions.

### Exam Access and Pre-Exam Actions

The exam will be provided as a Jupyter notebook (zip compressed and encrypted). There will be an exam repo (containing the Jupyter notebook, Statement of Originality to be filled, and relevant data sets), to which access will be enabled the day before the exam. The password will be posted on Piazza/Wattle at the start of the exam. 

A **FORK** of your exam repository has been already prepared for you in the exam server (so you do not need to fork anything). It is expected to be made available one day before the exam. You will find that the exam has been zip compressed and encrypted. Do not wait until the actual exam start time to **CLONE** your repo to get a local copy of your fork on your machine.

We will also make the Statement of Originality file available the day before the exam.  Please enter your name and student ID in the file, save it and do a COMMIT and PUSH immediately (on the day before the exam ideally after you have cloned the exam repository).  Then check that the change you made appears in the file through a browser (i.e. your name and student id have been saved in it).  This will help test that you can successful PUSH your file to the repo.  If there are issues, please report it asap so that we can help you resolve those before the exam itself and therefore reduce stress significantly.

There are two sample exams provided on the course website and the labs repository. You should test that you can download and decrypt the sample exam well in advance to be sure that your decryption works properly. You should also of course attempt the questions.

### On-campus access

If you are worried about having an unreliable connectivity or computer, then you can come to campus to do your exam if you are based in Canberra.  We have reserved a space with computers to help those who need it.  Please get in touch if you want to use the reserved space, you need to let us know in advance by 5pm on Friday 03 June 2022 to use this option.


### Instructions

1. A **FORK** of your exam has already been prepared for you and will be accessible from **11am on Friday 03 June**. It will be of the form:

   https://exam-gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/uxxxxxxx/comp2420-2022-final-exam

   Replace `uxxxxxxx` with your uid

2. Once the exam repo access is enabled (from 10am on Friday 03 June), **CLONE** this repository onto your local computer.   Please aim to do so between 10am to 5pm on Friday 03 June as there will be no support provided for troubleshooting after 5pm on friday until the exam start time on Saturday.  Do a test PUSH straightway after you have cloned the repo.  To do so, please add your name and student ID to the Statement of Originality which will already be available in the repo. Save, Commit and Push to the server.  Then check that you can see the changes made through using a browser and checking the SoO file.  If you face any issues, please flag immediately (on Piazza and/or email) so that you can get support with resolving before the exam.  Please note that if you do this after 5pm on friday, it might not be possible to provide support until the exam time as CECS IT will not be available.

3. Ten minutes before the actual exam start time, find yourself a cozy spot and **power down all communication channels**, except for the course Piazza forum.  You can do steps 4-7 within the ten minutes before the exam official start time.

4. Start your full screen **recording now**. Show your Identity document to the camera and make sure that the details on it can be clearly seen. Please refer the **Mandatory** Self-invigilation Instructions further below.

5. Get the decryption password from Piazza/Wattle. Use it to unzip and decrypt the exam. **Leave the zipped file as is. Do not delete this file.**

6. **Write your name and student ID to your statement of originality**  if you have not done so before. You can add references to this as appropriate later.

7. Open the Jupyter notebook containing the exam, write your name and Student ID in the top cell in markdown format.  Save the file.  **ADD** the exam file, the So0 (any file that you have changed) and **COMMIT** and **PUSH** righ away.  Check on a browser to see that you can see the changes made.  This will ensure that your uncompressed exam files are now in your fork on gitlab. It will also act as a check to ensure that your git push is working properly.  It will also ensure the PUSH at the end of the exam does not involve a large volume of data and therefore reduce likelihood of issues.

8.  If you have finished the exam admin steps early, you can read the exam notebook but do NOT start writing.  Once the exam starts, you can start writing if you wish, or you can take use some more time for reading.  There are 15 minutes allocated to reading but students are allowed to start writing in that time.

9. Fill in your answers. Add any references, as appropriate, to your statement of originality. All your activities must appear on your recording.

10. Don't forget to save, add, commit and push regularly. It is recommended that you do this after answering each question. Ensure that you **COMMIT and PUSH ALL OF YOUR WORK**  in your **LOCAL REPO BY THE DEADLINE**. We will mark the last version of your exam that was PUSHED by the deadline. Regular commits and pushes will ensure that you have work that has been committed before the deadline.  Make sure to **PUSH** your work by the deadline. If you pushed your work to the server regularly throughout the exam, then if the final push goes beyond the deadline because of any network/gitlab related issues, there will still be something for us to work with.

11. At the end of the exam (ie, once you have done your final PUSH to the server), stop your screen recording and make sure the video file is saved (keep this file for at least 60 days after the course is over). Save your video recording to your Microsoft One drive account and make sure to share the link with us through the relevant form on Wattle **within 3 days of the exam date**.


### Self-invigilation Instructions (Mandatory)

**Self-invigilation is mandatory for the exam**. Please note the following points (if your recording is missing any of these steps, it will be considered invalid):

You must record your screen including a clear live view of you during the entire exam. The recording must also capture sound during the entire duration of the exam.
At the beginning of the recording, **you need to show your ID at the beginning of the recording** (UNI ID, Driver’s License or Passport).

You must keep the self-invigilation recording for a few months (suggested: 60 days after the course ends) in case there are concerns about the integrity of the submission you made to gitlab. In this case, you can use the recording as evidence to support your case.

There are a number of software options that can be used to record your screen and a live view of you during the entire exam. You are free to use any software that works for you as long it can record your screen, sound and a live webcam image of you during the entire exam.

Some suggestions for software you could use are QuickTime for MacOS, OBS Studio (any OS), Zoom (you can log in with your ANU account and record in the cloud), or MS Teams (also through your ANU account and the recording will also be in the cloud). This list is not prescriptive, so please use any software that can do the job and that you are comfortable using. You may want to consider options where you can record to the cloud if space is an issue on your computer.

You NEED to upload your self-invigilation video to your university-provided Microsoft One drive account and share the link with the course instructors through the relevant form that will appear in Wattle under the block ‘Midsemester Self-Invigilation’. You have up to THREE days to upload the video to your Microsoft ONE DRIVE account and share the link with us using the form on Wattle. Failure to do so within the allowed timeframe will be considered a breach of examination conditions. **This will be strictly enforced for the final exam**

In case you have technical issues during the exam, use the form available on Wattle (to appear during the exam under the ‘Midsemester Self-Invigilation’ block) to report the issues. For example, crashing of recording, missing face/voice recording, computer crashes, network problems, etc. You have up to THREE days after the exam to report any technical issue. In case of technical issues being reported, you may be called for an oral examination to help in assessing your case. **No consideration will be given to issues reported after the allowed timeframe and the case will be considered as a breach of examination conditions.**

**All** monitors/screens that are being used must be recorded.

If you have any concerns about the self-invigilation process, let me know as soon as possible. Otherwise, I understand you are all set, and no major issues should happen during the exam.

### What you need to do before the exam:

Find yourself a trusted screen recording program and start recording your whole screen now. Ensure that you can include a live view of yourself and sound recording is working. Try showing your identity document to the camera and make sure that the details on it can be clearly seen and captured by your video.

Download the available sample exams as a zip file. Unzip to get the exam (as a Jupyter notebook) and associated data files.

Open the notebook.

Fill in your answers. All your activities must appear on your recording.

Remember to save frequently (if your systems are not doing that by themselves anyway).

Save the notebook, close it, and re-open: Are your answers still there?

Stop your screen recording and check whether the video file was successfully saved.

Have a warm beverage to celebrate your success in being prepared :-)

Do keep in mind that the sample exams has been provided as a zip file. The actual exam will be in an exam repo. See above for details.



### Do’s and Don’t’s:

Do not zip your notebook back before submission.  Leave it in its unencrypted form.

Feel free to ask questions by directly posting to “Instructors” on Piazza (public posting will be disabled for you during the exam).  Only relevant clarifications or technical difficulties will be addressed.  We will not be helping you with course material related matters as this is an exam.

The exam is open book, so if you feel the urge to look up something on your computer, this is fine.

Do not use any communication system (other than direct posts on Piazza to Instructors) during your exam. If you do, it will be counted instantly as collusion and will have serious academic honesty consequences.  

Do not upload any material and/or share anywhere other than your gitlab fork. If you do so, you will also become part of an academic collusion case which will stay on your permanent record at the ANU.

Be very very careful searching for any material on-line. If you find yourself seeing references to material which might be the result of collusion (which hopefully will not be the case), you are one click away from becoming part of a serious academic honesty case yourself. Remember that all of your activities must appear in your recording, and according to basic academic standards, we also expect you to reference anything that you might have included in your working, in your statement of originality. You will likely waste valuable time for your exam and expose yourself to serious risks, so we recommend that you defer from doing anything that can be construed as collusion.

Submit the link to your self-invigilation video recording within three days after the exam through the form on Wattle. We will only check this file if we have a specific reason to do so and it will help in supporting your case if there is an academic misconduct investigation.

Please note that all exam rules will be very strictly enforced for the final exam.  Make sure you are aware of the rules by reading these instructions carefully, a few times if needed, and ideally before the exam starts.

### Allowed Materials

**Open-book exam: You are allowed to use:**

your notes

course material such as lecture slides, live coding scripts, and lab solutions

reference materials or textbooks

and, consume content from the Web (but be careful here! Read below)

### Be advised that (important!!!):

You must submit solutions that are your own work for the exam. You are not allowed to collaborate with others on code/text during the exam.

If part of your solution comes from a particular reference, then you must make sure to make this clear and include details of the reference used.

You are not allowed to share/post any question to anyone, any website, forum, social media and alike.

You are not allowed to search for the question instructions, in part or in whole (hoping to find solutions).  You can search some key words to help you formulate an answer.  Everything must be visible in your self-invigilation video.

You must adhere to the academic integrity rules of ANU. (see CECS guidelines https://cecs.anu.edu.au/current-students/policies-and-resources/academic-integrity-and-misconduct)

You must fully understand and be familiar with the content of the course. If you don’t study, an open-book exam will not help you
You should not rely on the allowed materials, you will not have time for extensive reading during the exam.

You are not allowed to use any communication means to contact anyone, except the examiners via Zoom ** Violation of these rules may result in failure of the exam and/or an investigation in accordance with the rules of academic integrity of the ANU. **

### Topics for the Exam

Exam questions are expected to include all topics covered in the course (except the guest lecture by Prof Stephen Gould). Material covered in lectures, live coding demos and labs are all examinable.

### Oral Examination

All assessments in this course may be subject to an oral examination. We reserve the right to select a subset of students for follow-up oral examination, consisting of a small number of questions aiming to confirm their exam mark. If the examiners are not satisfied with the outcome of this oral examination, this may result in failure of the exam and/or an investigation in accordance with the rules of academic integrity of the ANU.

If for some reason, you are unable to provide a self-invigilation video (which is considered a breach of examination conditions), you will very likely be called for an oral examination, so be prepared for that eventuality.  

### Deferred Exams

After starting the exam (e.g., click on any question), you will not be eligible to defer the exam. The deferred exam may follow a different structure from the original mid-semester exam.

### Technical support

We will NOT offer technical support during the exam for things you should already know how to do. You must know how to:

- clone the fork of the exam repo, commit your changes and push to the gitlab server for submission
- call relevant library functions
- run and test your code We will also not offer content-related support as you are expected to be familiar with the material of the course.

we will be providing technical support for any relevant exam-related issues of course.

### During-Exam Support over Piazza
Please post to Instructors on Piazza during the exam if you require support.  
(note that public posting will be disabled.)

### Contingencies
We have put in place a number of contigency plans for some potential issues, which we hopefully will not have.  Please get in touch on Piazza if you are experiencing difficulties and we will guide you to help resolve.


### How to be successful

While the learning is what counts in the long run, your marks in this exam count for your immediate grade in this course, so let’s talk about how to make the most of it:

Be fit and ready. Your mind should be free and undistracted. You should have had a good night’s sleep. Taking a stroll before an exam is often the best preparation and/or being in a calm state.

Read carefully and think - don’t just look up, or memorise. All questions require reflection, abstraction and generating your own line of thought. There are no look-up questions. So don’t waste your time trying to find in which section of the course the answer is - there won’t be such a section.

Order your thoughts before you write. Are there multiple points you want to make? Which is the major one? Are all points directly addressing the question?

Be concise. Be careful about writing in half-baked ideas that are not properly explained, since we will count wrong statements as well and will balance them with your correct statements.

Last but not least, Good luck for your final exam!
