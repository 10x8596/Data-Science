    "You may be wondering how we are planning on teaching SQL concepts without actually using a _\"real\"_ database. While many DBMS such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) exist, there is additional overhead of installing items such as this, getting you used to them and getting them to interact with a Jupyter Notebook (or Python script, etc). While other courses (such as [COMP2400](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/comp2400)) will use PostgreSQL or other items, we are going to go with the simple option as this is an introductory course. Therefore, enter _SQLite_!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is _SQLite_ ?\n",
    "> SQLite is a C-language library that implements a [small](https://www.sqlite.org/footprint.html), [fast](https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html), [self-contained](https://www.sqlite.org/selfcontained.html), [high-reliability](https://www.sqlite.org/hirely.html), [full-featured](https://www.sqlite.org/fullsql.html), SQL database engine. SQLite is the [most used](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html) database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people use every day. ([reference](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why _SQLite?_\n",
    "The key difference from other DBMS: architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Normally, a DBMS such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc., requires a separate server process to operate. The applications that want to access the database server use TCP/IP protocol to send and receive requests. This is called client/server architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RDBMS-Client-Server-Architecture.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SQLite does NOT work this way. SQLite does NOT require a server to run. SQLite database is integrated with the application that accesses the database. The applications interact with the SQLite database read and write directly from the **database files stored on disk**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/What-is-SQLite.jpg)  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other reasons we choose SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's so light-weight that we do NOT need to install or configure anything since we are using its python interface (if you want to access the DB through command line like other DBMS, you need to install the commandline tool)\n",
    "2. PySQLite(*sqlite3* below): It is a python standard lib! We do not need to install any additional libraries!  \n",
