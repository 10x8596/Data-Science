    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "The following learning outcomes apply to this assignment:\n",
    "- **LO1** - Demonstrate a conceptual understanding of database systems and architecture, data models and declarative query languages\n",
    "- **LO2** - Define, query and manipulate a relational database\n",
    "- **LO3** - Demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding of descriptive and predictive data analysis methods, optimization and search, and knowledge representation.\n",
    "- **LO4** - Formulate and extract descriptive and predictive statistics from data\n",
    "- **LO5** - Analyse and interpret results from descriptive and predictive data analysis\n",
    "- **LO6** - Apply their knowledge to a given problem domain and articulate potential data analysis problems\n",
    "- **LO7** - Identify potential pitfalls, and social and ethical implications of data science\n",
    "- **LO8** - Explain key security concepts and the use of cryptographic techniques, digital signatures and PKI in security\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to submit the following items:\n",
    "- The notebook `Assignment_2_2022_uXXXXXXX.ipynb` (where uXXXXXXX is your uid) [Please note that if you have to pull from the upstream repo you will need to change the name back first and add your uid after the pull again]\n",
    "- A completed `statement-of-originality.md`, found in the root of the forked gitlab repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions are performed by pushing to your forked GitLab assignment repository. For a refresher on forking and cloning repositories, please refer to `Lab 1`. Issues with your Git repo (with the exception of a CECS/ANU wide Gitlab failure) will not be considered as grounds for an extension. Any variation of this will result in a `zero mark`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***** \n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is strongly advised to read the whole assignment before attempting it and have at least a cursory glance at the dataset in order to gauge the requirements and understand what you need to do as a bigger picture.\n",
    "* Backup your assignment to your Gitlab repo often. \n",
    "* Extra reading and research will be required. Make sure you include all references in your Statement of Originality. If this does not occur, at best marks will be deduced. Otherwise, academic misconduct processes will be followed.\n",
    "* For answers requiring free form written text, use the designated cells denoted by `YOUR WRITTEN ANSWER HERE` -- double click on the cell to write inside them. You can change these to Markdown cells where necessary (e.g. you may need to include some figures in your answer).\n",
    "* For all coding questions please write your code after the comment `YOUR CODE HERE`.\n",
    "* In the process of testing your code, you can insert more cells or use print statements for debugging, but when submitting your file remember to remove these cells and calls respectively. You are welcome to add additional cells to the final submission, provided they add value to the overall piece.\n",
    "* Your code answers will be marked on **correctness** and **readability** of your code, if your marker can't understand your code your marks may be deducted. \n",
    "* Your written answers will be marked on the **correctness**, **depth** and **clarity** of your written answers. If your marker cannot understand your answer, marks may be deducted\n",
    "* Before submitting, restart the kernel in Jupiter Lab and re-run all cells before submitting your code. This will ensure the namespace has not kept any old variables, as these won't come across in submission and your code will not run. Without this, you could lose a significant number of marks.\n",

Most users barely even think about how items in their news feed get picked.\n",

The results were even published in a reputable [journal article](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1320040111).

In other words, they demonstrated _\"emotional contagion\"_.\n",

So, did they share your contact information with Facebook? How does Facebook know you like that particular store when you have not posted about going there? (you did not want your Mum to find out you bought those clothes yet.)  It turns out that businesses can target customers already on their list through Facebook but your contact details are not directly shared.  To ensure your privacy, Facebook hashes the list of contacts that a particular business uploads for advertising before it gets used.  Facebook hashes contact information it already has of its own users before comparing with the hashed list from the business to see if there is a match.

But considering the ethics and/or privacy side of things, collecting user's data and using it to target the user in any manner would not be ethical unless they are given permission to do so which unless it's a well known, reputable company, most lesser companies would not ask for permission. Which makes you think whether every company deserves to access user's data and if only certain companies should have this right. Collecting user's data also comes with the tough responsibility of keeping it secure so that it's not breached which not many companies will have the resources  to do so. Regardless they still want to access their consumer's data."
